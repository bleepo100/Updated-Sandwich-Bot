 -DEV NOTE-
 I am currently in development of arbitrage functions for my 2.1 release. 
 Decentralized exchange arbitrage has piqued my interest as a more ethical means of passive income, though for the time being the 2.0 release solely operates as a sandwich attack bot on the Solana blockchain.
 I plan to implement these changes without charge to existing users of my project, though in the future new users will pay an additional fee to use arbitrage features.
